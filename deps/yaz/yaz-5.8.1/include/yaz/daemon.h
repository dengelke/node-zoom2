    This function puts calls work handler which is supposed to carry
    out a daemon service with a possible changed User ID and in a
    child process.

    Flag YAZ_DAEMON_FORK: Puts the service in the background on Unix.

    Flag YAZ_DAEMON_DEBUG: Puts the service in debug mode (no fork at all).

    Flag YAZ_DAEMON_KEEPALIVE: Repeatedly calls work handler if it makes a
    "fatal" error.
